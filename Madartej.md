#### Ingredients:

- 6 whole eggs
- 1 liter whole milk
- 6 tablespoons sugar
- 1 vanilla pod (or 1 tablespoon vanilla extract)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- A pinch of salt
- Lemon zest (for serving)

#### Instructions:

1. **Heat the Milk**:
    
    - Begin by heating the milk in a large pot. It should be hot but not boiling.
2. **Separate the Eggs**:
    
    - Separate the egg yolks from the whites. Be careful not to let any yolk mix with the whites.
    - Place the yolks in a medium bowl and the whites in a large bowl.
3. **Whip the Egg Whites**:
    
    - In the large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.
4. **Poach the Meringues**:
    
    - When the milk is hot, use a spoon to place 4 dollops of egg-white foam into the milk. These will resemble dumplings.
    - The meringues will puff up as they cook in the milk. Avoid overcrowding; cook only 4 or a maximum of 5 at a time.
5. **Prepare the Custard Sauce (Cr√®me Anglaise)**:
    
    - In a separate bowl, mix the egg yolks with sugar and cornstarch.
    - Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod (if using) and add them to the egg mixture.
    - Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg mixture while stirring continuously.
    - Return the mixture to the pot and cook over low heat until it thickens into a smooth custard. Let it cool.
6. **Assemble**:
    
    - Place the poached meringues in a serving dish.
    - Pour the chilled custard sauce around the meringues, allowing them to float like little islands.
7. **Serve**:
    
    - Chill the dessert and serve it in beautiful bowls.
    - For an extra touch, sprinkle the egg white clouds with fresh lemon zest just before serving.
