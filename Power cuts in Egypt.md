### Why Egypt Faces Power Cuts Despite Having Oil

1. **Energy Mix**:
   - **Oil**: Limited reserves, most used domestically.
   - **Natural Gas**: Significant reserves (e.g., Zohr field), but much exported.
   - **Renewables**: Growing, but not yet enough to meet demand.

2. **Rising Electricity Demand**:
   - Population growth (100M+) and industrialization have spiked consumption.

3. **Climate**:
   - Heatwaves lead to higher energy use (e.g., air conditioning), stressing the grid.

4. **Fuel Allocation**:
   - Balancing local use and export contracts causes fuel shortages at home.

5. **Aging Infrastructure**:
   - Power plants and grids struggle with inefficiency and maintenance issues.

6. **Economic Factors**:
   - Austerity measures and subsidy cuts raise fuel prices, affecting energy supply.

Despite having oil, Egypt's power cuts result from high demand, infrastructure issues, and economic priorities.
