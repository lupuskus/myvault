All three programs - Rip’s Starting Strength (SS), 5/3/1, and Juggernaut - are popular [[strength training]] methods, each with its own unique approach:

1. **Rip’s Starting Strength (SS)**: This program, designed by Mark Rippetoe, is a beginner’s program focused on linear progression. The lifter adds weight to the bar every session, focusing on compound movements like the squat, deadlift, and bench press. It’s simple, effective, and a great way for beginners to quickly build strength.
    
2. **5/3/1**: Created by Jim Wendler, this program is more suited to intermediate and advanced lifters. It uses periodization, cycling through different rep ranges over several weeks to balance strength and hypertrophy. [The program is flexible and can be tailored to the individual’s goals and needs](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/juggernaut-method-vs-5-3-1/162472)[1](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/juggernaut-method-vs-5-3-1/162472)[2](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=140936411).
    
3. **Juggernaut**: This method, developed by Chad Wesley Smith, is similar to 5/3/1 in that it uses periodization. However, it starts with higher rep ranges and gradually works down to lower reps, which can be beneficial for building both size and strength. [It also has a 10 rep phase to start things off](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/juggernaut-method-vs-5-3-1/162472)[1](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/juggernaut-method-vs-5-3-1/162472)[2](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=140936411).
