 

- **Darwin’s Theory**: [[Charles Darwin]] proposed [[evolution]] by natural selection, but the mechanism of inheritance was unclear.
- **Mendel’s Discoveries**: [[Gregor Mendel]]’s work on pea plants revealed principles of inheritance (genes, dominant/recessive traits).
- **The Modern Synthesis**: In the 20th century, Mendel’s genetics merged with Darwin’s ideas, forming a comprehensive framework for evolution.

**Key Figures in the Modern Synthesis**:

1. **Theodosius Dobzhansky**: Bridged the gap between Darwin’s ideas and Mendelian genetics.
2. **Ernst Mayr**: Emphasized population genetics and speciation.
3. **Julian Huxley**: Popularized the term “Modern Synthesis.”
4. **Ronald A. Fisher**: Contributed to mathematical aspects of population genetics.
5. **Sewall Wright**: Introduced adaptive landscapes
