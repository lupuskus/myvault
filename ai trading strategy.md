Step 1: Screen Which Currency Pair to Choose

1.	Identify Trending Pairs Using ADX:
- Check the ADX for major currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY).
- Look for pairs with an ADX value above 25, indicating a strong trend. This helps filter out pairs stuck in sideways movement.
2.	Check for Volatility with ATR:
- Review the ATR to confirm that there is sufficient volatility for trading.
- Choose pairs with higher ATR values that suit your risk tolerance. Higher volatility means higher potential profits but also higher risk.
3.	Confirm Trend with MACD:
- Use MACD to confirm the direction of the trend identified by ADX.
- A MACD line crossing above the signal line confirms an uptrend; below confirms a downtrend.

Step 2: Estimate Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR) and Expected Return

1.	Use ATR to Set Stop-Loss Distance:
- Determine the stop-loss level based on the ATR. For example, use 1.5 to 2 times the ATR as the distance for your stop-loss to ensure it is far enough to avoid noise.
2.	Estimate Reward Levels with Fibonacci Retracement:
- Apply Fibonacci retracement levels to the previous swing high/low.
- Identify potential target levels at 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8% retracement of the price move.
3.	Calculate the Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR):
- Aim for an RRR of at least 1:2 or 1:3 (risking 1 unit to gain 2 or 3 units).
- For example, if your stop-loss is 50 pips based on ATR, aim for a reward of 100–150 pips based on Fibonacci levels.

Step 3: Create Stops and Limits

1.	Set Stop-Loss with ATR:
- Place the stop-loss 1.5 to 2 times the ATR below/above the entry point, depending on whether you are long or short.
- Example: If ATR is 20 pips, set your stop-loss at 30-40 pips below the entry point.
2.	Set Take-Profit with Fibonacci:
- Use the Fibonacci retracement levels as target points.
- For example, if you’re entering after a 38.2% retracement in an uptrend, set your take-profit near the 61.8% or 100% extension of the move.
3.	Consider Trailing Stops with Parabolic SAR:
- Use Parabolic SAR as a dynamic stop-loss. Adjust your stop-loss as the trend progresses, allowing you to lock in profits.

Step 4: Create Entry and Exit Points

1.	Identify Entry Point with MACD and RSI:
- Look for MACD crossovers: Enter long when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (bullish crossover); enter short when it crosses below (bearish crossover).
- Check the RSI: If it’s between 30 and 50 in an uptrend, consider it a buy signal; if between 50 and 70 in a downtrend, it’s a sell signal.
2.	Use Bollinger Bands for Timing:
- If the price is near the lower Bollinger Band in an uptrend, it might be a good entry point (oversold condition).
- If it’s near the upper Bollinger Band in a downtrend, it could be a good sell entry (overbought condition).
3.	Exit Point:
- Use the opposite MACD crossover or a reversal sign on RSI (e.g., RSI entering overbought/oversold territory) to exit your trade.
- You can also exit if the price hits your take-profit target set at the Fibonacci level.

Strategy Example in Practice:

- Pair: EUR/USD
- ADX: Above 25 (indicating a strong trend)
- ATR: 30 pips (moderate volatility)
- MACD: Bullish crossover (buy signal)
- RSI: At 45, confirming uptrend (not overbought)
- Fibonacci Retracement: Entry after 38.2% retracement, targeting 61.8%.
- Bollinger Bands: Price near the lower band, signaling a good buy entry.
- Stop-loss: 1.5 * ATR (45 pips below entry).
- Take-profit: Fibonacci level at 61.8% (targeting 90 pips).
