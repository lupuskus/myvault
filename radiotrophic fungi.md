[[Nuclear waste]]

## 1. Discovery at [[Chernobyl]]
- **Radiotrophic Fungi**
  - Thriving in radioactive environments
  - Examples: *Cladosporium sphaerospermum*, *Wangiella dermatitidis*

## 2. Radiation Processing Mechanism
- **[[Melanin]]**
  - Absorbs gamma radiation
  - Converts radiation into chemical energy (Radiosynthesis)
- **Radiotropism**
  - Grows toward radiation sources
  - Incorporates radioactive particles
  - **tropic** relates to directional responses to stimuli, while **trophic** concerns nutritional levels and feeding relationships within ecosystems.

## 3. Ongoing Research
- **Bioremediation**
  - Reducing radiation levels in contaminated areas
  - Potential for cleaning up [[nuclear waste]]
- **Genetic Studies**
  - Understanding and enhancing radiation resistance

## 4. Potential Applications
- **Environmental Remediation**
  - Harvesting fungi for storage of radioactive materials
  - Preventing leakage of radioactive particles
- **[[Space Exploration]]**
  - Developing biological radiation shields for spacecraft
- **Medical Applications**
  - Protecting patients during radiation therapy

## 5. Conclusion
- **Value of Radiotrophic Fungi**
  - Not eliminating radiation sources but stabilizing and incorporating radioactive materials
  - Innovative strategies for managing radioactive contamination in various contexts
