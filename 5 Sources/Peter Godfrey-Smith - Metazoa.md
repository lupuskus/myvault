[[Consciousness MOC]]
- Aristotle - Different levels of soul (inanimate, animate, human)
- Descartes - only humans have soul
- In the 50s new distinction between:
	- Simple soul activities like memory and even intelligence etc
	- Subjectivity (only human?)
- Materialism - Dualism - Panpsychism
**Afterword gives summary**
- The book supports gradualism
- Mind is not the result of neural activity. It is how to have a nervous system.
- It is difficult how non neural intelligence could develop mind.
- Mind is the result of multiple connections in a stream of sensations and actions, including connections to the body.
- Consciousness is linked to offline experience like:
	- Episodic memory
	- Future imagination
	- Dreams
	- Daydreams
- [[Octopus]] and (distributed) consciousness
