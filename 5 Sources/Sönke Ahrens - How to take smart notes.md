 **Introduction**
 - What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years **before** we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?
 - once you are in \[ academia \] a superior **IQ** will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).
 - **Willpower** is, as far as we know today, alimited resource that depletes quickly
 - self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves
 - Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success

**Everything you need to know**
- A good **structure** enables **flow**
- Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making **plans** about something.
- It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around.
- rather be an expert than a planner.
- Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations
- high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome,
