1. **[[Uranium]] Projectiles**
   - **Key Users**
     - **United States**: DU rounds used in the A-10 Warthog (GAU-8 cannon) and M1 Abrams tank (120mm shells).
     - **United Kingdom**: Challenger 2 tanks with 120mm DU rounds.
     - **Russia**: Developed DU munitions (less publicized use).
     - **NATO Allies**: Some testing or possession, e.g., France.
     - **Other Nations**: Possible use by China, India, or others with advanced tank capabilities.
   - **Purpose**
     - High-density projectiles for armor penetration.
     - Effective against heavily armored targets like tanks.

2. **DU in Rifles and Guns**
   - **Not Used**
     - DU is impractical for small arms due to:
       - **Weight**: Too dense for portability.
       - **Cost**: More expensive to produce than traditional ammunition.
       - **Overkill**: Unnecessary for typical small arms engagements.
   - **Alternatives**
     - [[Tungsten]] used in specialized small-caliber armor-piercing rounds.

3. **[[Pyrophoric]] Materials**
   - **Definition**
     - Spontaneously ignites when exposed to air.
     - Reaction with oxygen generates enough heat to cause ignition.
   - **Characteristics**
     - **Self-Ignition**: Does not require external spark or flame.
     - **Sensitivity to Oxygen**: Ignites at room temperature or lower.
   - **Examples**
     - **Metals**
       - Finely divided iron.
       - Uranium and depleted uranium (DU).
       - Plutonium.
     - **Organometallic Compounds**
       - Triethylaluminum.
     - **Others**
       - White [[phosphorus]].
       - Alkali metals like sodium and potassium.

4. **Connection to [[Depleted Uranium]] (DU)**
   - **Pyrophoric Properties**
     - DU ignites during high-velocity impacts (e.g., friction, deformation).
     - Produces uranium oxide particles and intense heat.
   - **Military Applications**
     - Armor-piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds.
     - Aircraft cannon shells, e.g., in the A-10 Warthog.
   - **Health and Environmental Concerns**
     - Release of fine uranium oxide particles during ignition.
     - Potential long-term contamination and toxicity.

5. **Importance of Pyrophoric DU in Military Use**
   - **Armor Penetration**
     - Combines high density with ignition to destroy armored targets.
   - **Tactical Advantage**
     - Superior to non-pyrophoric materials like tungsten in specific applications.

6. **Alternatives to DU**
   - **Non-Pyrophoric Materials**
     - Tungsten as a safer alternative with similar density and penetration capability.
   - **Why Not DU Everywhere?**
     - Environmental and political concerns.
     - Limited need for pyrophoric effects in smaller munitions.
