[[Dark matter]]

#**Abstract**: The authors propose an alternative approach to [[quantum gravity]], where the spacetime metric remains classical while matter fields remain quantum. In this framework, the metric evolves stochastically. Surprisingly, this stochastic behavior leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. Key points include:

1. **Stochastic Spacetime**: The theory posits that spacetime’s metric evolves stochastically, introducing intriguing consequences.
2. **Low Acceleration Regime**: At low accelerations, the variance in acceleration due to the gravitational field dominates over the Newtonian potential. This high variance acts as an **entropic force**, causing deviations from Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
3. **Diffusion Regime**: In this regime, the entropic force behaves gravitationally, explaining galactic rotation curves without invoking [[dark matter]].
4. **Experimental Signature**: The deviation from general relativity due to spacetime’s Brownian motion serves as an experimental signature.

Further understanding and numerical simulations are needed to validate these ideas.
