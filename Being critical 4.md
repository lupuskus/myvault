[[being critical 3]]

How to continue?

Your revised outline is already rich and thought-provoking. To build on it, you could consider adding the following elements:

### 1. **Philosophical Deep Dive: Locus of Criticism**
   - You touch on this in **Section 4**, but expanding on *who* is responsible for criticism could enrich the argument. In modern medicine, does the locus of critique shift between the individual doctor, the collective medical establishment, and AI? Who holds accountability when tools and data critique us rather than the other way around?

### 2. **Critique vs. Constructive Criticism**
   - Expand on the difference between destructive vs. constructive criticism, especially in medicine. In **patient safety** or **clinical practice**, how can criticism be directed in a way that enhances care instead of demoralizing staff or stifling creativity? This could relate to your Coroner's court/Root Cause Analysis point.

### 3. **Cognitive Biases**
   - Exploring cognitive biases in medical decision-making could add depth. How does **critical thinking** act as a safeguard against biases such as **confirmation bias** or **anchoring bias**? Does externalizing critique to AI help overcome these, or does it introduce new challenges (e.g., **algorithmic bias**)?

### 4. **Ethical Considerations of AI Critique**
   - You mentioned doctors possibly being criticized for not using AI in the future. This could lead into a discussion of the **ethics** of automated decision-making and responsibility. Who bears the brunt of criticism when AI is involved? Does it create a **moral buffer** between doctor and patient, and how does that affect trust?

### 5. **Literature Review**
   - Look into **critical pedagogy** in medical education (Paulo Freire’s work might help). Does modern medical training encourage critical thinking, or does it push young doctors to conform to standardized procedures, risking intellectual stagnation?
   - Also, there's literature on the **externalisation of medical knowledge**. How has this shaped the role of a doctor from being the source of knowledge to being a navigator of systems?

### 6. **Practical Example or Case Study**
   - Adding a case study or a real-world example of how being "critical" saved lives or avoided medical errors could anchor your argument. It could also demonstrate where being overly critical (second-guessing) delayed necessary intervention.

### 7. **Cultural Criticism and Medical Humanities**
   - Bringing in the **medical humanities** perspective could offer a fresh angle. Does the growing bureaucratization and technologization of medicine dampen the humanistic, empathetic side that critical thinking should support? Medical professionals often need a balance of **rationality** and **empathy**—how do we teach that balance?

### Structure Refinement:
- It might help to integrate **Section 5 (Critical Thinking vs. Action)** and **Section 6 (Educating Young Doctors)** since they both deal with how critique functions in practice.
- The **historical/philosophical considerations** could also flow into a broader discussion of **critical thinking vs. externalisation**—so that might be merged.

As for the literature, looking into works on medical epistemology and critiques of evidence-based medicine (e.g., **Trisha Greenhalgh** or **John Ioannidis**) could offer theoretical backing for some of your points on critical thinking and the over-reliance on AI/EBM.
