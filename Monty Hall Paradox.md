[[everyone should know logic]]

- Imagine you’re on a game show, faced with three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats. After you choose a door, the host (Monty Hall) opens one of the other doors, revealing a goat. Should you stick with your initial choice or switch? The counterintuitive answer lies in probability theory.
## Why Does Switching Work?
- If you rigidly stick with your first choice (Door A), your chances remain at **1/3**.
- But if you switch, you’re essentially choosing the other door (Door C), which has the remaining **2/3** chance of hiding the car.
