- #abigail is not doing well in coping with all the things that happened to her: epilepsy, losing her licence, losing her pregnancy, failing her studies. 
- #nathan had a car accident yesterday when his mate turned the cat over while drunk. They all just run away. Now Nathan feels he has a concussion. Anything could happen to him anytime. To us too, but much less likely.

- On the book table in the hotel I found the #book 'Der Bauchnabel' by [Matthias Biskupek](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Biskupek#:~:text=Matthias%20Biskupek%20(*%2022.%20Oktober,deutscher%20Schriftsteller%2C%20Publizist%20und%20Literaturkritiker.)
