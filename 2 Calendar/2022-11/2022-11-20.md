#journal 

- Time wise I #sleep enough.  I wake up more often,  but fall asleep easily again. It is hot at night.  The watch detects a lower HRV, which can be die to heat, #alcohol and/or dehydration.
- At home there is a clear pattern on the watch: on the weekend sleep score around 50, during the week around 80, which clearly points to the rule of alcohol and alcohol related dehydration. 
- Today is market in Teguise.
- RunningLog: Recovery run with Sarah.  She persevered.  Not using FinalSurge, Strava or Garmin as my running diary anymore.  It's Zettel only,  tagged by #run.
- [x] #home washing line ✅ 2024-04-03
- We wanted to walk to the Teguise Market, just to realise that it is in Teguise village 30' by bus away.  Then missed the bus as we could not get a face mask fast enough
- Strong winds. Nice waves. 
- [x] #home clothes rack ✅ 2024-04-03
- The model of [[BJ Fogg - Tiny Habits|Fogg]] is simple and practical. 
- Listened to some cocktail music.  Thought about [[Songs to explore]].
