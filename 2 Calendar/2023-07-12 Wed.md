- Today it is the day of the [[battle of the boyne]] when [[Charles II]] forces were beaten by [[William III of Orange]]. 
- Listening to [Friday explorations](https://youtube.com/watch?v=we9KhmONyTA&feature=shareb) of [[Robert Pirsig - Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance]] with Joseph Cot√©. Very good. 
- [[conflict resolution]] workshop in York with Joe Reilly and Wendy cowie. I am not necessarily good at it, but maybe I am.
