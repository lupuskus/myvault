- Used onenote again for a while (from beginning of Feb 23)
- Last weekend I also restarted [[bullet journal]]. I will keep them parallel for a while.
- With new Macbook I have restarted Obsidian again
	- Mac and iPad work closely together
	- Vault can be shared on iCloud
	- All important tools (AI, Office365, [[Zotero|Zotero]]) are available on both
	- Mobile phone can be reduced to an pure input device
- Woke up and my brain was working.  Otherwise #sleep  has been all right the last few months. No thinking at night. It helps to say "No need to think about it now", "there is nothing that I can do about it now" and focus on the breath.
- [x] Will use obsidian to take notes when reading [[Simon Western - Leadership]] ✅ 2024-04-03
- [x] Will also revisit my [[Nietzsche]] notes ✅ 2024-04-03
- Will not use obsidian for work and stay with onenote, sharepoint, outlook and paper
- I must have deleted quite a bit of images that contained mind maps, such as [[20181110 Leadership - Jim Easton]]. I have to be mindful of not deleting them when I purge images.
- [ ] cancel Apple care #money 
- transfer of OneNote to obsidian
	- Consider bulk transfer (see [[Obsidian vs OneNote.pdf]] in OneNote)
	- Copy text and paste whenever a OneNote note is used
	- Transfer whole section (how?) if needed.
	- Create directory of pages and sections
- Test entry from work on iPad.
	- Successful. First upload to icloud failed. Then syncronised when I came home.
