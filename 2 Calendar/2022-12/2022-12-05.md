- [Git lose object error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11706215/how-can-i-fix-the-git-error-object-file-is-empty)and then [pack-objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54301016/error-remote-unpack-failed-eof-before-pack-header-was-fully-read) error. Seem to occur if computer crashes while syncing. Then a [dangling tree error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16955523/git-broken-links-missing-dangling-trees).  I have to clone the remote repo.
	- Cloning was successful. File dates were however changed to cloning time. Maybe I can reconstruct it with some hidden data in obsidian.
	- in the future I have to give unique IDs.

- Becca's daughter is non verbal. Reminded me of Benji. Ask Philipp how he has developed.
- Dropped my car at the garage eventually.
