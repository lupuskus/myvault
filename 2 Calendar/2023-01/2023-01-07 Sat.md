- Different training plans and dietary regimens are like religions with every proponent picking the arguments that they need to prove their point.
	- In running there is a common message in the MAF and 80/20 programme. McMillan & First training plans can be made compatible with these programs but differences remain. 
	- Same for diets. Vegan, vegetarian, flexitarian, mediterranian diets have common messages. Differences however remain about meat and the right balance between carbs and protein. For me, diets need to prove their benefit in epidemiological studies as opposed to odd chemical speculations, eg 'if you eat Ã—,then your body gets Y, which will lead to less cancer or other benefits.
