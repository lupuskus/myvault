Considering going back to #onenote 

- Reason 1: reliable sync and offline working across all devices  
- Reason 2: just returned back to onenote at work 
- Reason 3: access of home notes from work (for time being) 
- Reason 4: all features of #obsidian can be reasonably well emulated 
- Reason 5: scanning and over facilities from all mobile devices 
- Reason 6: one inbox (on lupuskus@hotmail.de) for all devices 
- Reason 7: enough space, if i am sensible and not use it as dumping site for content 
- Reason 8: need for one consistent system that takes all ChatGPT stuff
