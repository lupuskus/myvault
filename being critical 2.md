Your essay concept touches on a fascinating intersection of language, philosophy, and medical practice. Here's an outline that could guide the structure of your argument:

### Title: *Being Critical* or *Critical Thoughts about Criticism*

---

### 1. **Introduction**
   - Briefly introduce the multifaceted use of the term "critical" in medicine and beyond.
   - Pose the central question: What does it mean to be "critical" in medicine today?

### 2. **Usage of 'Critical' in Medicine**
   - **Critical Appraisal:** Methodical evaluation of research evidence. Highlight its role in evidence-based medicine.
   - **Critical Care:** Life-saving interventions under urgent, life-threatening circumstances.
   - **'No criticism implied':** Explain the paradox in patient safety investigations, like root cause analyses and Coroner's court, where 'criticism' is avoided, yet implied.

### 3. **Common Usage and Historical Roots of 'Critical'**
   - **Everyday Use:** 'Don't be so critical'—implies negativity.
   - **Historical Perspective:**
     - **Critical Theory (Frankfurt School):** Leftist critique of capitalist structures, focusing on how society can be questioned.
     - **Stalin's 'Criticism and Self-Criticism':** A perverse, enforced form of critique that suppressed individuality.
     - **Biblical Criticism:** Another form of intellectual scrutiny, asking questions that challenge long-held beliefs.

### 4. **Philosophical Locus of Criticism**
   - **Being a Critical Subject:**
     - A doctor (or individual) as a critical thinker relying on personal judgement.
     - **External Criticism:** The growing reliance on tools (EBM, AI), which raises questions: Are we critiquing data, or are we being critiqued by the tools?

### 5. **What is Being Criticized?**
   - **Self vs. Others:** Should doctors be more critical of their own judgement or rely on collective medical knowledge?
   - **Tension for Doctors:** Balancing personal clinical judgement vs. scientific consensus vs. AI guidance.

### 6. **Critical Thinking vs. Action in Medicine**
   - **Analysis vs. Action:** Critical thinking informs decisions, but alone does not ensure action. Is there a risk that being critical delays action or deters confidence in decision-making?

### 7. **Implications for Modern Medicine**
   - **Autistic Thinking (Bleuler) vs. Disciplined Criticism:** Drawing on Bleuler's concept of undisciplined thinking, argue how critical thinking in medicine requires discipline and rigour.
   - **Externalisation of Critical Thinking:**
     - **Network Meta-Analyses and AI:** In earlier decades, doctors could understand the methodology behind studies, but modern research increasingly relies on models that clinicians must accept, sometimes without fully grasping the underlying process.
     - **Human Element:** What AI or EBM cannot replace is the human aspect—emotions, empathy, and the subjective understanding of patients' experiences.
   
### 8. **Educating Young Doctors**
   - **Balance:** Encourage critical thought alongside evidence-based practice, but also foster an awareness of mainstream assumptions.
   - **Disillusionment in Medicine:** Explore how some doctors lose faith in the profession, turning to other pursuits, only to find themselves disillusioned again.

### 9. **Informed Consent**
   - **Critical Patients?** The increasing expectation that patients should be critical thinkers in their own care, despite often lacking the tools and understanding, exposes the limits of informed consent.

---

### Conclusion
   - Summarize the evolving role of critical thought in medicine and question whether the future of medicine will diminish or enhance the role of the 'critical doctor.'
   - Emphasize the need to preserve the human aspect in an increasingly automated and data-driven medical field.
