Ball and Seldon in the Guardian argued that nine conditions defined the likelihood of Conservative defeat. These were: 
- a negative image of the leader
- confusion over policy direction
- internal disunity
- organisational disarray
- weakened party finances
- a hostile media and intellectual climate
- public dissatisfaction with the economy
- a “time for a change” mood
- a credible opposition party.
