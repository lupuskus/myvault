- ugliness
- Something is ugly if there is a difference in what the object means and the subject thinks of it
- The ugliness does not lie in the object or the subject but in the relationship between these
- “the real ugliness lies in the relationship between the people and the things they produce. This results in a similar relationship in the people that use it”
- The ugliness that is produced this way is covered by style.
