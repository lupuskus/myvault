Friston's Free Energy Principle and his Error Prediction Minimization theories are closely related concepts. The Free Energy Principle is a broader theoretical framework that encompasses the idea that biological systems, including the brain, minimize free energy to maintain their internal states in a state of equilibrium. This principle extends to perception, action, and learning.

Error Prediction Minimization is a specific application of the Free Energy Principle. It suggests that the brain's primary function is to reduce the discrepancy between its predictions about the environment and the actual sensory input it receives. By minimizing prediction errors, the brain can update its internal models and better adapt to its surroundings.

In summary, Error Prediction Minimization is a practical application of the Free Energy Principle, aimed at explaining how the brain processes information and learns to reduce the discrepancies between its predictions and sensory inputs.
