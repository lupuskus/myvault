## Evidence of Negative Time
- Researchers at the University of Toronto observed "negative [[time]]" in a [[quantum]] experiment with [[photons]] and atomic excitation, where photons exited an ultracold [[Atoms]] cloud before excitation was complete.

## Quantum Experiment Details
- The experiment involved shooting photons through an atom cloud, revealing:
  - Photons exited before atomic excitation finished.
  - Some photons traveled without interaction but still excited atoms.

## Unexpected Photon Behavior
- Key findings challenged conventional understanding:
  - Negative transit times were measured.
  - Photon absorption and reemission followed a probabilistic model.

## Interpreting Negative Time
- "Negative time" reflects quantum measurement peculiarities, not actual time reversal, highlighting limitations of classical time concepts in quantum systems.

## Study Status and Reactions
- The study is awaiting peer review, generating excitement in the scientific community. Researchers expressed surprise at their findings, emphasizing the need for validation.

## Relation to the Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The second law states that total entropy in an isolated system cannot decrease, providing a foundation for time's arrow. Negative time does not reverse this law:
  - Quantum mechanics operates differently from classical [[physics]].
  - The second law remains robust at macroscopic scales despite rare quantum fluctuations.
