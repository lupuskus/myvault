Was it alice in wonderland who drinks something and goes into a rabbithole?

Yes, that's correct! In Lewis Carroll's novel "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," the titular character, Alice, follows a talking rabbit down a rabbit hole after spotting it carrying a pocket watch and exclaiming that it is late. She then drinks a potion labeled "Drink Me," which causes her to shrink, allowing her to enter the rabbit hole and begin her adventures in Wonderland.
