- Propositions are not true or false in themselves, but only as utterings of propositions, because of words like "now", "this table", "I".
	- It is right to talk about a proposition being right or wrong if we avoid such implicit words and make them explicit, like "1 Jan 2000 00:00", "the dining table in 12 Easby Lane", "Wolfgang Kuster, son of Lothar, born on 15 Aug 1964 in Cologne, Germany"
- Propositions are true or false because of their role in a network of meaning
	- this does not contradict to "propositions are true or false because of the meaning of the signs '+', '=', '^' etc."
- Propositions of experience are at the edge of this network. We rarely talk about them but rather about connections of them.
- If propositions in the network of meaning become false, we have to amend some propositions. We avoid changing our experiences or propositions that are central to our network. Sometimes we have to change some of them.
- we also like to simplify our systems/networks, even of this changes or central propositions
