## Clinical signs
- Tachycardia
- Seizures/myoclonus
- Myocarditis
- Cholinergic syndrome
- Orthostatic hypotension
## Clozapine toxicity
- Summarise
- Falls were likely alcohol related at the time as Sean's presentation on assessment was unchanged
## Pregabaline
- Seen as safe drug in therapeutic doses and the absence of abuse
- No evidence for abuse in Sean 
- Respiratory depression likely in patients who abuse it
- MRSA warning from 2019 related to misuse of pregabaline. Sean was not a misuser. 
- New MRSA warning from 2021 does not change this
## Infection
- Biggest risk of infection is pulmonary infection as this is generalised (cytokines inhibiting clozapine metabolism) and increased mucous liquid can negatively interact with infected secrets 
- Bladder infection likely did not have general symptoms
-  leukocytes were normal in December
## Caffeine
- This has not been widely known at the time.
- Not mentioned in clozapine section of 2021 Maudsley guidelines and Stahl's clozapine handbook says that the clinical relevance is unclear
- Case reports that mainly focus on caffeine *withdrawal*
- in Sean we would need to expect an *increase* of his caffeine use
- Constant high use, could have been an opportunity to bring clozapine levels down, but this could have also led to a deterioration of Sean's mental health
- Caffeine mainly seen as stimulant that can impact mental health
- The trust's clozapine clinics are now actively asking for caffeine use. I am not sure what other trusts do. 
## Orthostatic hypotension
- Tested on 18/12/19, 14/1/20, 26/2/20 & 10/7/20 (Russell Philips)
- Usually linked with clinical signs
- Usually in first 4 weeks of treatment
- 3 measurements have confirmed this
## ECG
- RBBB 13/2/24
- [x] Get ECG âœ… 2024-08-18
- People usually die with it and not from it
- Dangerous if it becomes a bifascicular block, but this would have made clinical symptoms
