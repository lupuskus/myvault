# Growing Lemongrass from Supermarket Stalks

## Starting Lemongrass
- **Select fresh stalks**: Green, firm, with intact base. Roots visible is a plus.
- **Preparation**: Optionally trim the top to 10-12 inches.

## Rooting in Water
- **Place in water**: Submerge base in a glass of water on a sunny windowsill.
- **Change water**: Refresh water every few days.
- **Wait for roots**: Roots should appear in 2-4 weeks.

## Transplanting to Soil
- **Soil planting**: Once roots are a few inches long, plant in well-draining soil.
- **Outdoor planting**: Ensure frost risk is over and weather is warm.

## Care After Planting
- **Watering**: Keep soil moist as it establishes.
- **Sunlight**: Place in a sunny area or spot.

This method allows you to recycle supermarket lemongrass into a fresh supply for your kitchen, adding a tropical flair to your garden or home.
