[[Git]] is a **version control system**, while GitHub is a **cloud-based Git repository hosting service**. You do **not** need GitHub to use Git.

## Alternatives to [[GitHub]]

### 1. Cloud Drive (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Store a Git repository in a cloud-synced folder.
- **Risk:** Syncing conflicts may occur, especially with the `.git` folder.

### 2. Self-Hosted Git Server
- Use **GitLab (self-hosted)**, **Gitea**, or a **bare Git repository** on your own server.
- **Advantage:** Full control over repositories.

### 3. Local Storage Only
- Keep the repository on your local machine.
- **Advantage:** No external dependencies, but lacks remote backup.

### 4. Other Git Hosting Services
- **GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge**, etc., offer Git hosting similar to GitHub.
