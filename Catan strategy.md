1. **Claim Hexes with Good Dice Odds**:
    - Look at the numbers (pips) on the hexagonal tiles. Place your settlements on hexes with higher pips (higher probability of rolling those numbers). For example:
        - 5/6/9 or 5/8/10 are good placements.
        - Avoid the desert and coastal hexes.
        - Remember that 7 is the most likely roll but activates the Robber.
2. **Resource Diversity**:
    - Aim for settlements that give you access to all five resources: wood, brick, sheep, wheat, and ore.
    - Collect all five resources early to build more settlements, roads, and cities.
3. **Maximize Pips**:
    - Place settlements where you’re likely to roll for important resources.
    - Prioritize hexes with more pips (higher probability of rolling those numbers).
4. **Ports**:
    - Consider coastal settlements with adjacent ports (especially those matching your best resource tiles).
5. **Distribution of Numbers**:
    - Try to get a variety of number placements to stay relevant throughout the game.
    - A mix of different numbers ensures you won’t be left out due to dice rolls.
