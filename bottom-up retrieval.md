- if there are no [[links]] or [[connections]] you cannot retrieve [[memory]] content.
## strategies
- [[A-Z retrieval]]
- use all senses (try to think of everything related to what you want to remember, until it suddenly comes up, don't tense up!)
- use [[Alexa]], [[web search]] or [[AI]] (this will however make you dependent on technology, which fine if the topic is rare and not important. If you need to remember it often, try to create links in your mind)
