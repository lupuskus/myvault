## 1-Point Perspective (Central Perspective)
- **Single vanishing point** on the horizon line.
- Lines recede towards the central point.
- Used for front-facing subjects with depth receding into the distance.
## 2-Point Perspective (Angular Perspective)
- **Two vanishing points** on the horizon line.
- Used for objects viewed at an angle.
- Sides of objects converge towards the vanishing points.
## 3-Point Perspective (Bird's/Worm's Eye View)
- **Two vanishing points** on the horizon line, **one above or below**.
- Depicts objects from extreme viewpoints.
- Used for tall buildings (looking up) or high vantage points (looking down).
## 4-Point Perspective (Cylindrical Perspective)
- **Four vanishing points**: two on the horizon, one above, one below.
- Creates a panoramic effect with less distortion than fisheye.
- Lines for vertical and horizontal directions remain straight.
## 5-Point Perspective (Fisheye Perspective)
- **Five vanishing points**: four as in 4-point plus a central point.
- Curved lines create spherical distortion like a fisheye lens.
- Used for dramatic space and depth, especially in artistic works.
## Parallel Perspective (Orthographic Projection)
- No vanishing points.
- Parallel lines remain parallel.
- Common in technical and engineering drawings for true scale representation.
