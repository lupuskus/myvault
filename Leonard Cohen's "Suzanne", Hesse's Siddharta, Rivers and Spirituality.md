#### **Analysis of [[Leonard Cohen]] "Suzanne"**:
- **Themes**: Spirituality, love, longing, and disconnection are central themes. The song blends the sacred and the profane, using religious imagery to explore complex emotions.
- **Imagery**: The river symbolizes life's flow, time, and emotions. Christian references, like Jesus as a sailor, highlight human suffering and divine mystery.
- **Structure**: The song’s repetitive verse-refrain structure emphasizes obsession and the cyclical nature of longing.

#### **Connection to [[Hermann Hesse - Siddhartha]]:
- **The [[River]]**: Both in Cohen’s "Suzanne" and Hesse’s *Siddhartha*, the river symbolizes the flow of life, time, and spiritual journey. In *Siddhartha*, it represents timelessness, unity, and the path to enlightenment, which parallels the spiritual journey in "Suzanne."
