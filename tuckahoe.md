- The term "tuckahoe" can refer to different plants and fungi, and its use has varied historically. In your case, the tuckahoe you purchased is likely related to the sclerotium of the fungus *Wolfiporia extensa*, also known as Poria cocos. This fungus is used both as food and in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as "fu ling" [3][4]. The sclerotium is a hardened mass of mycelium that grows underground and has been used by Native Americans and the Chinese for its nutritional and medicinal properties [1][3][4].

Additionally, the term "tuckahoe" has been used to describe various tuberous plants like *Peltandra virginica* and *Orontium aquaticum*, which were also used as food by Native Americans [2][5]. The name originates from the Algonquin language, meaning "it is round," and historically, it has been associated with both fungi and tuberous plants [1][2].
