1. **Direct Interactions**:
    
    - **[[Aztecs]] and North American Tribes**: While direct warfare between the Aztecs and specific North American tribes (such as the Apache or Comanche) is not well-documented, there were indirect interactions.
    - [**Trade**: MesoAmerican goods have been found among the **Pueblos of New Mexico**, suggesting trade connections](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/aagm6e/did_the_aztecs_have_any_interactions_with_the/)[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/aagm6e/did_the_aztecs_have_any_interactions_with_the/).
    - **Possible Routes**: Some historians believe that MesoAmerican (including Aztec) traders may have traveled along the **Rocky Mountain corridor**, interacting with sedentary groups and trading as far as New Mexico. [Evidence is circumstantial, including Pueblo drawings depicting clothing similar to Aztec attire](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/aagm6e/did_the_aztecs_have_any_interactions_with_the/)[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/aagm6e/did_the_aztecs_have_any_interactions_with_the/).
2. **Context**:
    
    - Itâ€™s essential to recognize that the specific North American ([[Indian]]) tribes we know today (like the Comanches and Apaches) did not exist in their current form during the height of Aztec power.
    - The Apaches and other nomadic or semi-nomadic groups inhabited the region stretching from Central Mexico to present-day Canada.
3. **Fall of the Aztec Empire**:
    
    - [In 1521, **HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s** and indigenous allies conquered **Tenochtitlan**, leading to the fall of the **Aztec Triple Alliance** under **Moctezuma II**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/aagm6e/did_the_aztecs_have_any_interactions_with_the/)[2](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Native_Peoples_of_the_Americas/Mesoamerican_Cultures/Aztecs).

In summary, while direct conflict is less documented, indirect trade and cultural exchange likely occurred between these distinct civilizations. If you have more questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
