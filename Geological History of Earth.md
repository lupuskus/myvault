Hadean Eon** (4.6 billion - 4 billion years ago):
  - Intense asteroid bombardment.
  - Volcanic activity shapes early Earth.
- **Archean Eon** (4 billion - 2.5 billion years ago):
  - Formation of continents.
  - Emergence of primitive [[life]] forms.
- **Proterozoic Eon** (2.5 billion - 541 million years ago):
  - [[Great Oxygenation Event]].
  - Evolution of complex life forms.
### Phanerozoic Eon
- **Paleozoic Era** (541-252 million years ago):
  - *Cambrian Period*: "[[Cambrian Explosion]]" diversifies multicellular life.
  - *Ordovician Period*: Land colonization by plants; diverse marine life.
  - *Silurian Period*: Vascular plants appear; marine life diversifies.
  - *Devonian Period*: "Age of [[Fishes]]"; tetrapods colonize land.
  - *Carboniferous Period*: Coal swamps; [[amphibians]] rise.
  - *Permian Period*: [[Reptiles]] spread; [[Permian-Triassic extinction]].
- **Mesozoic Era:
- Triassic Period (252-201 million years ago):
- Ended with the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, which occurred approximately 201 million years ago. This event resulted in the extinction of numerous species, paving the way for the dominance of dinosaurs during the Jurassic Period.
- Jurassic Period (201-145 million years ago):
- Ended with the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event, around 145 million years ago. While not as severe as some other extinction events, it led to significant changes in marine ecosystems, including the decline of marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.
- Cretaceous Period (145-66 million years ago):
- Ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, approximately 66 million years ago. This event resulted in the mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, as well as many other plant and animal species, likely caused by a combination of factors including asteroid impact and volcanic activity.
- **Cenozoic Era** (66 million years ago - present):
  - *Paleogene Period*: Mammal diversification; early primates.
  - *Neogene Period*: Modern mammals evolve; early humans.
  - *Quaternary Period*: Glaciations; Homo sapiens spread; extant biodiversity.
	- Pleistocene Epoch (2.58 million years ago - 11,700 years ago): Glacial and interglacial cycles; Homo sapiens evolve and spread.
	- Holocene Epoch (11,700 years ago - present): Rise of human civilizations; current geological epoch.
	  - [[Anthropocene]]?
