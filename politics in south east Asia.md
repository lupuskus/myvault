| **Indonesia**    | Presidential Democracy                          | **Democratic, but with challenges**: Indonesia is one of Southeast Asia's most democratic countries, with direct presidential and parliamentary elections. The transition to democracy began in 1998 after Suharto’s authoritarian rule. However, issues like corruption, military influence, religious conservatism, and human rights concerns persist.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Malaysia**     | Parliamentary Monarchy                          | **Semi-democratic with strong central control**: Malaysia has a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system, with a King as head of state. Elections are held, but the ruling coalition (primarily the United Malays National Organisation, or UMNO, until recent years) dominated politics for decades, maintaining power partly through gerrymandering and ethnic-based policies. Although the opposition has gained more power in recent years, political dynamics remain complex. |
| **Cambodia**     | One-party Dominance                             | **Authoritarian**: Cambodia is effectively a one-party state under Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985. Although there are elections, the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) consistently wins, often amid allegations of electoral fraud and suppression of opposition. Independent media and civil society are also tightly controlled.                                                                                                                            |
| **Laos**         | Communist One-party State                       | **Strictly Authoritarian**: Laos is a socialist state under the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, with no genuine political opposition. The party controls all aspects of governance, and civil liberties are tightly restricted, especially freedom of the press and freedom of assembly. Political opposition is not allowed, and all media are state-owned.                                                                                                                               |
| **[[Thailand]]** | Constitutional Monarchy with Military Influence | **Hybrid system with military influence**: Thailand’s democracy is often interrupted by military coups, the most recent in 2014, after which the military controlled the government until elections in 2019. Despite returning to a parliamentary system, the military still wields significant influence, and restrictions on freedom of expression remain. The monarchy is highly revered and protected by strict lèse-majesté laws.                                                       |
| **Vietnam**      | Communist One-party State                       | **Authoritarian**: Vietnam is governed by the Communist Party of Vietnam, with no opposition parties permitted. The state controls most aspects of society, including media and civil society, and restricts freedom of speech and assembly. While there is economic openness, political reforms have not accompanied economic growth, and dissent is quickly suppressed.                                                                                                                    |
