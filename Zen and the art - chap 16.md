- [[Phaedrus]] two phases in thinking about [[quality]]
- [[Imitation and teaching]]
- [[Grading]] in school and university
- Withholding grades is (relatively) popular among good student and (unanimously) unpopular among bad students. 
- the idea behind withholding grades is that students will create their own criteria of [[quality]]  this assumes they know what quality is. This is against the assumption that student needs to be taught a sense of quality.
