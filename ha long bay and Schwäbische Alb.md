# Concept Map: Geological Processes and Features

## 1. Ha Long Bay
- **Geological Processes**:
  - *Tectonic Activity*: Formation and uplifting of limestone seabed.
  - *Erosion and Karstification*: Rainwater erosion, chemical weathering creating pillars and caves.
- **Key Points**:
  - Composed of limestone karst formations.
  - No volcanic origin.

## 2. Swabian Alb
- **Similarities to Ha Long Bay**:
  - **Limestone Composition**: Ancient seabed deposits.
  - **Karstification**: Caves, sinkholes, and cliffs.
  - **Tectonic Uplift**: Exposure due to tectonic activity.
- **Distinctions**:
  - Inland, not at sea level.

## 3. Roseberry Topping
- **Geological Composition**:
  - Made of sandstone and shale, not limestone.
- **Formation**:
  - Result of sedimentary processes and erosion.
- **Comparison**:
  - Less similar to Ha Long Bay than the Swabian Alb.

## 4. [[Karstification]] (Definition)
- **Process**:
  - Dissolution of soluble rocks (e.g., limestone) by acidic water.
- **Features Created**:
  - *Caves and Caverns*
  - *Sinkholes*
  - *Limestone Pavements*
  - *Karst Towers*
  - *Disappearing Streams*
- **Conditions**:
  - Presence of water and COâ‚‚ for forming carbonic acid.
