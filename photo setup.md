[[Photography]]
- On holidays I keep turning to my standard zoom (16-55) lens even though the range is not good. I donâ€™t really bother about the quality, as it is so much better than the phone still. 
- The phone is ok for wide angle, but poor for tele
- So, why not carry a [[Tele lens for a6000]]? I would use the phone for most clicks and the camera if tele or camera adjustments are required.
