[[Trading]]
- Maybe look at the range of the last 10 min and set the stop loss a bit higher than the max range. Set the [[win limit]] 4 times the [[stop loss]]. 1:4 [[risk reward ratio]].
- Or better:
	- Look at the normal duration of a [[trend]]/[[momentum]]
	- Look at the max level range during this time
	- This will give the max win/loss I can reasonably expect
	- a risk reward ratio to 1:4 gives you the win limit
