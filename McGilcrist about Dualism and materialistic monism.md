- Descartes was right that the only thing we can be certain of is consciousness. He was wrong as treating both mind and brain as things, a left-brained mode that is concerned about the whatness of things. 
- Materialism is doing the same by reducing the mind to matter, explaining it away.
- The mind is however not a thing but rather a process. 
- There is only one whatness but two hownesses or qualities.
