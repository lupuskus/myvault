The [[Aztecs]] used two intertwined [[calendars]]:
## The Year (xihuitl)
- Consisted of 18 “mēztli” (sections), each with 20 days.
- An additional unchanging 5-day section followed the 18th section to complete the 365-day year.
- The names of the sections were associated with festivals celebrated at their end.
## The Ritual Calendar (tōnalpōhualli)
- Had a fixed duration of 260 days.
- Also known as the “Tonalpohualli” or “Tonal Count.”
- The [[Stone of the Sun]], often mistakenly called the “Aztec Calendar Stone,” is a monolithic sculpture from the ancient main temple area of [[Teotihuacan]] in [[Mexico]] City [[Tenochtitlan]]. It features calendar symbols on its inner ring and serves as a fascinating testament to Aztec culture and their complex timekeeping systems.
