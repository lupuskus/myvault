- a self directed learner is a learner who creates their own standards what they want to learn. They know what is good and what is [[quality]]. 
- This does not mean that they teach themselves. They buy in help and coaching to learn skills that are required to achieve quality. 
- Such learners do not need a university, but they might chose it because:
	- They realise that society is expecting university degrees
	- They appreciate that university are where great minds come together, so that all can learn more
