Question
I am reading the book how not to age by Michael Greger. In the chapter about epidemics he says that genes are switched off by methylation when people age. So it sounds like methylation is accelerating adding. He then says that increasing the methylation capacity can slow down aging. This sounds like a contradiction to me. Can you resolve this?

Bard answer:

methylation and aging:

2. **Methylation** can silence genes by adding methyl groups to their DNA.
4. **Aging** is linked to changes in methylation patterns, with some **protective genes getting silenced** and some harmful ones potentially getting activated.
6. **Increasing methylation capacity**might not be universally bad. It could potentially help keep the right genes methylated and functional, slowing down aging.
8. The overall effect of methylation depends on **which genes are targeted**and the **person's lifestyle**.
