[[ADHD]]
- Adult ADHD is a valid diagnosis that can persist into adulthood associated with significant functional impairments.
- Variability exists in quality of adult ADHD assessments and diagnosis. Standards are needed to ensure accurate diagnoses and optimal care.  
- The UK Adult ADHD Network developed the Adult ADHD Assessment Quality Assurance Standard (AQAS)[1] to define standards for diagnostic assessments.
- Comprehensive assessments involve developmental history, symptom and impairment evaluation, comorbidity screening, and differential diagnoses consideration.  
- Informant interviews and supplementary information should be obtained where possible.
- Assessments should take a minimum of 2 hours to allow sufficient time for all required components.
- Assessors should undergo specific adult ADHD training and assess mental health conditions clinically with supervision recommended for some.
- Diagnoses should only be made following structured assessment using established criteria like DSM-5 demonstrating impairments in at least two domains.
- Post-assessment involves discussion of diagnosis, treatment options, and psychoeducation.
- Adhering to AQAS standards aims to improve quality, reliability and validity of adult ADHD assessments and diagnoses.
