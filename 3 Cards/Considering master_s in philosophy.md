Dear Dr Kuster

Thank you for your email.

For MA in Philosophy (F30), you must hold a UK honours degree (or equivalent), in philosophy or a related subject.  If you've got a degree conferred without honours, or that does not contain at least 20% philosophy related subjects, or with relevant experience in this field, you may still be eligible to study this qualification, subject to adjudication by the qualification team. 
For more information on the entry requirements here is a link to the course page: https://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/f30 

If you still wish to enrol onto MA in Philosophy, you can begin your registration on the first module website which is, MA Philosophy Part 1: https://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/modules/a853#registration 
The final enrolment date for this module is 14/09/2023. Once you register onto this module, our faculty will begin entry checks to determine if you are eligible to begin studying this module. 

In regards to your previous studies, you could possible be eligible for a credit transfer onto this course. 
If you’ve successfully completed some relevant postgraduate study elsewhere, you might be able to count it towards this qualification, reducing the number of modules you need to study. You should apply for credit transfer as soon as possible, before you register for your first module. For more details and an application form, visit our Credit Transfer website: https://www.open.ac.uk/study/credit-transfer/

Hello

I am a medical doctor and have studied medicine in Germany with the degree of the medical state examination.

In 2010 I signed up for an open BA degree and completed the AA100 course with 60 credits.
Since then I have not done any studies due to work commitments.

I am now emailing you if there is any chance to go straight to the Master?s Degree in Philosophy or if I have to complete a full BA course.

Best regards
Wolf
