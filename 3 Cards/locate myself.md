#wolf #leadership 

- I am a 58 year old white German male from working class background with university education
- I have had a protected childhood with not very emotional parents, but with emotional stability and no financial worries.
- I have gone through life without significant traumatic experiences
- As a consultant in the NHS I am well respected, albeit not without my little shortcomings.
- I am not the best father but still a bit of a role model for my children
- how I see myself, how I see others, how others see me
