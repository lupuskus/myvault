Specialist services in the new management structure

	• What was the strategic objective?

	• Different in CDDFT and NYY

Problems

	• CDDFT:

	• no collective leadership

	• No defined boundaries to planned care, 

	• to operational services

	• What constitutes a specialist service?

	• Specialist services carry some of the highest patient safety and reputational risk (Autism, Personality disorder). This is however not reflected in the structure. 

Models

	• CDDFT model

	• NYY model

	• CNTW model

Situation by service 

	• Perinatal 

	• Eating disorder

	• Persistent symptoms

	• ADHD

	• ASD

	• Personality disorder

	• Veterans

	• Deafness

	• Dual diagnosis?

	• DD strategy

	• ...?

Option analysis

	• Integration as a unity into planned care

	• (Partially) dissolving and integrating

	• CNTW model

	• DTVF model (possible but this downgrades specialist services)

	• Defined boundaries between specialist and operational services
