-         This is my work to do file, based on [https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/](https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/)

-         Mark every date with heading1

-         Use of **tags**

#pJoBl patient related stuff, including tasks like

#pJoBl  T2

#i idea

#job

#adhd #asd etc

#appraisal

#suresh colleagues or trainees, marked by first name. If necessary, use last name, eg #markA or #markJ.

#t template, adding specifier like #t24 for 24 hour reviews

-         Use of **context** markers for item tasks

@c at ward

@w or @wf waiting for

@o at office

@a anywhere where there is internet access

@h at home, either work tasks to do at home or home tasks

@z transfer stuff into Zettelkasten

@z stuff to transfer to Zettelkasten

If a task is complete, delete the @ sign and replace by completion date in brackets, eg

[2022-11-23, submitted to MHA office] MHA  report LC

Search for ‘@’  to get all open tasks, or ‘@c’ for all ward related tasks.

-         daily **routine**

-                look at the daily todo list

-                do scheduled things

-              when free time, do floating tasks or work on red emails

-                at the end of the day review Orange/Yellow emails to see if they need any handling

-               copy the next day’s calendar items to the bottom of the text file

-         **Pictures** shouldn’t really be used, to keep file lean and searchable for text.

Some information... A bullet point counts as second hierarchy level. Everything without a bullet point is information belonging to the last bullet point.  

·        Sub-bullets for bullets within this information

-         **Project** work can leave the file and go into Zettelkasten (but only there)

-         If stuff is transferred to Paris or the Zettelkasten, the **raw stuff** can stay in this file (unless I decide otherwise)
