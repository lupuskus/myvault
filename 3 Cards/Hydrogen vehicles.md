## Types of Hydrogen

1. **Grey hydrogen**: Produced by splitting carbon from methane, but with carbon emissions as a by-product[^1^][1]. Common and cheap, but not compatible with net zero goals.
2. **Blue hydrogen**: Produced similarly to grey hydrogen, but with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to reduce emissions. Cleaner but more expensive.
3. **Green hydrogen**: Produced by electrolysis using clean electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen[^2^][2]. Zero-emissions but costly.

## Vehicle Comparison

| Vehicle type | Fuel source          | Emissions (at point of use) | Cost       | Range           | Refueling time |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Electric    | Battery              | None                         | High       | Moderate        | Long           |
| Hydrogen    | Fuel cell            | None                         | High       | High            | Short          |
| Petrol      | Internal combustion | High                        | Low        | High            | Short          |
