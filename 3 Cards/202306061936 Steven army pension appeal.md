- You dismissed my report on grounds of
	- Partiality, and
	- Lack of standard that a report requires
- I have however
	- declared my relationship to mr gray
	- Expect that a proper psychiatric report would have also been dismissed
- I accept that my report is not an appropriate expert opinion, but mr gray still has the right for you to respond to a person that is clearly acting on his behalf
- I would like you to reconsider your view. Otherwise I will recommend mr gray to seek legal advice. It can then be decided if you have a duty to consider the content of my report or if, alternatively, an independent expert should be instructed. Such an expert will be able to also decide which report is more impartial:
	- The one written by a person that is clearly dependent on the army pension scheme, or
	- A family member, who happens to be a psychiatric expert and who has clearly declared this.
