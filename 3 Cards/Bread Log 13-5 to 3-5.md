• Jamie's sourdough starter  
• Sourdough is doing all right. Smells a bit puky. Made pancakes with discarded starter (80 starter, 80 flour, 160 milk, 1 egg, some baking powder).

• Started my first bread (Boddy):  
○ 60g (instead of 50g in recipe) Sourdough starter (it has doubled for the first time)  
○ 330?g water  
○ 8g (7g) salt  
○ 500g tesco extra strong bread flour (14% protein)  
22/4  
• First Sourdough bread  
○ Bulk rise went well.  
○ Did not flour the surface when turning over the bulk and ripping it quite a bit.   
○ It did not seem to rise very well in second rise. Over- or underproofing?  
○ Bread baked at 230° in Dutch oven. It turned out well but could have been fluffier.  
○ In total very happy with the result  
• Tiger bread  
• Received bannetones  
26/4  
• Second bread after the first one was a bit too dense  
○ 500 Flour  
○ 350 water  
○ 100 Sourdough  
○ 7 salt  
• Autolysis 1hr  
• Tried Bertinet stretch and fold twice  
• Bulk rise overnight  
• If overproved, next time less Sourdough or less time (which is difficult overnight)  
29/4  
• 3rd Sourdough bread the best so far. 5 hours bulk rise on kitchen top, then 2 hours in basket (all times from memory) on kitchen top and then in 30° oven. Still a bit dense in middle.
