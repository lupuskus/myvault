## Facts
- (All/Most?) elite athletes use 80/20 training (Seiler, Fitzgerald)
- No final evidence which metric is best for training (pace, heart rate, power, PE)
## Assumptions
- 80/20 is also best for amateurs
	- Injury reduction
	- Aerobic capacity
- Pace training 
	- is easy 
	- is what eventually aim for
	- Varies with hills, wind, temperature, terrain, condition or personal state
- Heart rate training 
	- appears to be roughly equivalent to PE
	- Good for long runs
	- Can be used indoors and outdoors
	- Has a normal drift in longer runs
	- Reacts too slow on hills and sprints
- Power training
	- Immediate response to effort changes
	- Poor accuracy in different terrains 
	- doubts about accuracy (indoors/outdoors, Garmin/Stryd)
	- Treadmill running appears to show lower power (and speed) in relation to heart rate and PE. In doubt I rather trust the latter.
- Zone 2 Easy Heart Rate is equivalent to Zone 1 Easy Power
## Conclusions
- Easy and (most) indoor runs should be based on heart rate
- Intervals and races should use power
- Unsure about tempo/threshold runs (outdoor power, indoor heart rate)
- Still need to estimate conversion factors for power and heart rate.
