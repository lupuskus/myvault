**change a file on device**
- (touch not enough)
- ~/.../shared/termuxgit $ git status
- Edit commit message
- git push 

**add file**
- git add
- git commit - a
- git push

**change a file on git server repository**
- commit when editing online (still need to check if server is changed by one device. How can another device notice this? )
- Git pull

**problems**
- Files changed on server and locally. Then files first need to be pulled and then pushed. 
- What if there are conflicts in one file?
