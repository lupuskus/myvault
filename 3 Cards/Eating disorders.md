**Key Changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11:**

1. **Specificity and Expansion**: ICD-11 provides more specific categories for eating disorders, including the explicit recognition of binge eating disorder as a distinct category, which was previously subsumed under broader, unspecified eating disorder categories in ICD-10.

2. **Diagnostic Criteria Updates**: While the table does not detail specific diagnostic criteria, it's important to note that ICD-11 has updated these criteria to reflect current research and clinical practice insights, aiming for more precise diagnosis and treatment.

3. **Coding System**: The transition to ICD-11 introduces a more granular coding system, allowing for greater specificity in diagnosis. This is part of a broader effort to improve data collection and analysis for healthcare planning and monitoring.

4. **Focus on Severity and Impact**: ICD-11 places greater emphasis on the severity and impact of symptoms on individual functioning. This approach supports a more nuanced understanding and treatment planning for individuals with eating disorders.
