- good reading does not need to underline or mark anything while reading. Active recall and reprocessing is however required. That needs to be recorded in a trusted system. 
- Condensed summaries should be separated from own ideas that the text triggers either by the tag #idea or (better) linking and separating the idea from the note. It can even be a title only note.
