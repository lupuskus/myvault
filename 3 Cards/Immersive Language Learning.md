## Process
1. Take a text:
	- that is slightly more difficult than your level
	- that interests you
	- that you have as a text in your mother tongue and a text and audio in your target language
2. Read the text in your mother tongue
3. Read test in target language until you can read it fluently (even if small bits remain unclear)
4. Listen to text in target language over and over again. 
5. The more you get familiar with the text,  go back to details that you still don't fully grasp (eg. grammar or idioms).
6. Move on to next text but return to this text
	- the next day
	- the next week
	- the next month
	- after 3 month
	- after one year
