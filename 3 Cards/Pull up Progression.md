- [Inverted rows](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/inverted-row-are-you-missing-out-on-this-great-exercise/).

## Plan
- Find lowest level that I can do 3 sets of 5
- Go one level lower
- Find max reps up to 5
- Get sensible progression up to 3x5. Always first set should be the level that has been mastered already.
