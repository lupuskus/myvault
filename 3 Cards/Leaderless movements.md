[[Simon Western - Leadership]]
#leadership 

- New social groups (Occupy), facilitated by technology, social media
- informal leadership within leaderless movements
- leadership can become redundant if the task/cause intrinsically motivates 
- distributed leadership can arise, ie leaderful groups (Starhawk)
- this can lead to denial with consequences
	- leadership reappears under different name
	- experimental new forms of organisation
	- new hidden oligarchies form
- pressure for unity within these movements (Anarchos)
- Skilful abuse (Freeman - the tyranny of structurelessness)
	- Lack of structure promoteted so that it can be abused
	- The powerful hide power structures behind structurelessness
	- The powerful are hidden
	- Creation of in-groups that exclude out-groups
- other consequences
	- Indecisiveness
	- Impotency (eg in rotation of work leaders or the un security council)
- structure is required
- The question is 'what type of leadership?' Not 'Leadership yes or no?'
