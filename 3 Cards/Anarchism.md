[[Simon Western - Leadership]]

- [[Mikhail Bakunin]]
	- does not reject leadership
	- leadership must 
		- not be attached to the person
		- be mutual with 
		- voluntary authority and  subordination 
- This should best be made explicit
- Problems arise if people are in denial and believe they are leaderless
