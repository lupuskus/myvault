A driver diagram is a visual tool used to depict the key drivers, or factors, that influence the success of a change initiative. Here's an example of a driver diagram for the change initiative to develop a low threshold substance misuse program for people in crisis:

Goal: Develop a low threshold substance misuse program for people in crisis

Primary Driver: Improved Mental Health Outcomes

Secondary Drivers:

1. Collaboration and Partnership:
    
    - Enhanced collaboration between mental health crisis services and substance misuse services
    - Establish a formal partnership agreement
2. Accessible Services:
    
    - Develop low threshold services that are easily accessible to individuals in crisis
    - Reduce barriers to entry, such as complex intake procedures or long wait times
3. Holistic Approach:
    
    - Integrate mental health and substance misuse services to address both aspects simultaneously
    - Incorporate harm reduction strategies and crisis stabilization techniques
4. Staff Training and Skill Development:
    
    - Provide joint training for staff from both mental health crisis services and substance misuse services
    - Develop shared knowledge and skills in supporting individuals in crisis with substance misuse concerns
5. Coordinated Care and Referral System:
    
    - Establish clear protocols for referrals between mental health crisis services and substance misuse services
    - Ensure seamless coordination of care and information sharing between the two services
6. Community Engagement and Awareness:
    
    - Promote the low threshold substance misuse program in the community
    - Collaborate with local organizations, community leaders, and advocacy groups to raise awareness

Measurement and Monitoring:
