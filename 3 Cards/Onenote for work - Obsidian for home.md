## Tags

-   Tags as unifying system (xxTagcontent in Onenote and #tagcontent in Obsidian)

## What goes where?

-   Everything that is related to work processes stays in Onenote
-   Everything patient related that is not needed anymore, should be considered for deletion
-   Everything that is work related knowledge, should be considered for transfer to Obsidian, especially if it is anything that I created
