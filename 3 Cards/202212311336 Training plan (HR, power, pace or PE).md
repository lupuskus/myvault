- Heart rate training appears to be very slow. Heart rate zone 2 is equivalent to power zone 1.
- Power meter on treadmill appears inaccurate. It underestimates the belt speed by about 10%.
- I feel that heart rate is probably coming closest to perceived exertion.
- Confused.
- Let's stick with the [Garmin heart rate based training plan](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/training-plan?tab=Scheduled&trainingPlanId=36204595).
