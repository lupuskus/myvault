## My story
- It helped me to get on top of my tasks. At least whenever needed.
- Other tools, such as Covey or referencing tools (Para, Zettelkasten).
- Get stuff out of your brain towards an external system
- Does not think about importance. Everything is processed, even if it is just deleted.
- It will remain my mainstay in dealing with stuff, but it needs value based tools (Covey) or and add-on to help dealing with non-linear information.
