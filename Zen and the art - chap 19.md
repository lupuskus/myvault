- [[Dilemma]]: is [[quality]] subjective or objective?
	- If it is subjective, is it Worth talking about?
	- If it is objective, why can we not detect it
- [[How to refute a dilemma]]
- Solution: quality is neither subjective nor objective. It is something third. 
- It happens when the subject encounters the object. It is an event that makes awareness of the object possible
- It is the source of subject and object and not the result
