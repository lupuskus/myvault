2. **Statistical Analysis**:

1. **Submit Paper for Peer Review**:
   Prepare the manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed [[dual diagnosis journals]]. Involve a co-author who will handle the statistical analysis and consider including a proofreader from the partnership provider. This collaborative approach will enhance the paper's credibility and ensure accuracy in data representation. At this stage, you can name the organisations involved, providing transparency and context for the research.
4. **Create a Poster for the International Conference**:  
   Design an additional poster tailored for the International Conference of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]. Highlight the innovative aspects of your project and its implications for mental health care. This poster will not only disseminate your findings to a broader audience but also facilitate networking opportunities within the field.
