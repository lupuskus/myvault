## Discussion on Geoengineering

### Pros
1. **Rapid Climate Impact**: Techniques like solar geoengineering can quickly lower Earth's surface temperature by reflecting sunlight.
2. **Reversing Climate Damage**: Aims to actively reverse some effects of climate change, potentially buying time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### Cons
1. **Ecological Risks**: Sudden termination of solar geoengineering could lead to rapid global warming with devastating ecological consequences.
2. **Incomplete Solution**: Does not address the root cause of climate change—greenhouse gas emissions—and could worsen ocean acidification.
3. **Unintended Consequences**: Potential negative impacts include changes in precipitation patterns and ozone layer depletion.
4. **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited understanding of long-term effects and risks makes it a controversial approach.

### David Keith's Advocacy
David Keith, a professor at Harvard and now at the University of Chicago, is a proponent of solar geoengineering. He suggests:
- **Method**: Injecting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight, inspired by the cooling effect after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption.
- **Feasibility**: Claims it is technologically feasible and cost-effective.
- **Risks and Ethics**: Acknowledges significant risks and ethical concerns, including unforeseen ecological consequences and the moral hazard of reducing incentives for cutting carbon emissions.
