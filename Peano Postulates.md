1. Zero is a natural number: 0 is a natural number.
2. Successor function: Every natural number n has a unique successor, denoted as S(n).
3. No two numbers have the same successor: For all natural numbers m and n, if S(m) = S(n), then m = n.
4. Induction principle: If a property holds for 0 and also for the successor of any natural number for which it holds, then it holds for all natural numbers.
5. Axiom of extensionality: If two sets have the same elements, then they are the same set.
