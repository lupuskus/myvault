- The First Fitna (656-661 CE): The First Fitna occurred after the assassination of the third of the [[Caliphs]], Uthman ibn Affan, in 656 CE. It involved a power struggle and conflicts between different factions within the early Muslim community. One faction supported Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad, as the rightful caliph, while another faction challenged his leadership. The First Fitna culminated in the Battle of Siffin in 657 CE, which was a major conflict between the forces of Ali and the forces of Muawiyah, the governor of Syria. The civil war ended with the arbitration at Adhruh, but the division among Muslims persisted, leading to further tensions and the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661 CE.
- The Second Fitna (680-692 CE): The Second Fitna occurred primarily as a result of a power struggle within the Umayyad Caliphate after the death of the caliph Muawiyah I. It involved conflicts between the Umayyad and Zubayrid factions. One of the major events during this period was the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, in which Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, was killed. This battle became a defining moment in the schism between Sunni and Shia Islam.
- The Third Fitna (744-747 CE): The Third Fitna was a civil war that took place during the Umayyad Caliphate. It began with the rebellion of various factions against the Umayyad caliphate under the leadership of different contenders. Eventually, the Umayyad Caliphate was overthrown, and the Abbasid Caliphate was established, with its capital moved from Damascus to Baghdad in 750 CE.
