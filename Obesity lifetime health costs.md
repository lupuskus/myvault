Net Lifetime Health Expenditure: Obese vs. Normal Weight People

### Findings from Studies

- **Ohsaki Cohort Study**: 
  - Obese individuals have higher lifetime medical expenditure compared to normal weight individuals, despite shorter life expectancy.
- **Netherlands Model Study**:
  - Yearly health costs highest for obese people until the age of 56.
  - Total lifetime health spending was greatest for healthy-living individuals, lowest for smokers, and intermediate for obese people.
- **Implications**:
  - While obese individuals incur higher health costs earlier and have shorter life expectancies, lifetime expenditure is influenced by various diseases and life years gained by non-obese individuals.
