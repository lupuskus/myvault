### Text Guidelines for an A0 Poster
1. **Overall Text Amount**:
   - Aim for **600-800 words** in total. This includes section headings, bullet points, and captions for tables and figures.
2. **Sections and Content**:
   - **Title**: Short and concise (1-2 lines).
   - **Aim**: 1-2 sentences.
   - **Method**: 2-3 bullet points or sentences summarizing the methodology.
   - **Results**: 
     - Key findings in bullet points (4-5 points).
     - Instead of detailed tables, consider summarizing critical data in 1-2 visual graphics.
   - **Discussion**: 4-5 bullet points highlighting implications and conclusions.
   - **Keywords**: A small section at the bottom (4-5 keywords).
3. **Visual Elements**:
   - **Figures**: Ensure each figure is clearly labeled. Aim for 1-2 sentences of description under each figure.
   - **Tables**: If you decide to keep the tables, use them to summarize key data points succinctly (2-3 rows each, depending on the complexity). If replaced with a graphic, ensure it is clear and informative.
4. **Patient Journey Graphic**: 
 - Create a flowchart or pathway diagram showing the patient journey from initial referral to onward referrals. This visual should highlight key touchpoints, the integration of services, and connections to external providers. Use icons and arrows for clarity.
### Design Considerations
- **Font Size**: Use a minimum of 24-30pt for body text and 36-48pt for headings to ensure readability from a distance.
- **Color Scheme**: Choose a cohesive color palette that aligns with your project's theme. Use contrasting colors for text and backgrounds to enhance readability.
- **Whitespace**: Ensure there is enough whitespace to avoid a cluttered look. This helps guide the viewer's eye and makes the poster easier to digest.

### Layout Suggestions

- **Top Section**: Title, authors, affiliations.
- **Middle Section**: Aim, Method, Results (with visual graphics), Patient Journey Graphic.
- **Bottom Section**: Discussion, Keywords, References (if space allows).
