- Being 14 or so Mama and Papa got a book of [[Heinrich BÃ¶ll]] at the Bertelsmann book club that was a part of his collected works. It was gray with just simple but stylish letters at the cover. I pictured myself reading it in a bed with white linen and a Mosquito net over it. It was just pure beauty. 
- I later saw that same beauty in some books and places in the [[DDR]]. Nobody else saw it. 
- It was all pure [[aesthetic]]. No [[Art]]
- Around the same time I discovered the [[aesthetics of enlightenment]]
