[[Psychopathology]]

- Prior to all other cognitive functions
- It changes the object to us
- [[Science]] tries to avoid this. The view from nowhere (Nagel)
- It changes us too
- It creates value unlike other cognitions

- [[Fish -Psychopathology]] is not referring to it at all. 
- [[SIMS]] describes it in the symptom level and distinguishes it from [[concentration]]. Also passive and focused/active attention.
