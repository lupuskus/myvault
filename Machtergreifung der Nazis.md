[[Adolf Hitler]]
[[Nazis]]
[[German History]]
## Key Stages of the Nazis’ Rise to Power

1. **Heinrich Brüning** (March 1930 - May 1932)
   Leader of the Centre Party. His tenure was marked by economic difficulties during the Great Depression and reliance on presidential decrees.

2. **Franz von Papen** (June 1932 - November 1932)
   A conservative who attempted to bypass the Reichstag and rule through presidential decree. His government was seen as ineffective and led to his downfall.

3. **[[Schleicher]]’s Chancellorship (Dec 1932 - Jan 1933)**  
   Schleicher fails to stabilize the government, facing opposition from conservatives and lacking support from the Reichstag.

4. **[[Papen]]’s Conspiracy Against Schleicher (Jan 1933)**  
   Papen, seeking revenge after his ousting, conspires to make Hitler Chancellor, believing he can control him.

5. **Hitler Appointed Chancellor, Papen Vice-Chancellor (Jan 30, 1933)**  
   Papen and conservative elites miscalculate, thinking they can "box in" Hitler.

6. **Reichstag Fire and Emergency Decree (Feb 27-28, 1933)**  
   The fire is used to invoke emergency powers, arresting communists and suspending civil liberties.

7. **Enabling Act Passed (Mar 23, 1933)**  
   Hitler is granted dictatorial powers, bypassing the Reichstag. Papen’s influence begins to wane.

8. **Night of the Long Knives - Operation Kolibri (June 30 - July 2, 1934)**
   Hitler eliminates [[Röhm]] and other SA leaders and other opponents, consolidating power,  justified by allegations of a plotted [[Röhm Putsch]] Schleicher assassinated. Papen narrowly survives the purge.

10. **Hitler Becomes Führer (Aug 2, 1934)** 
After [[Hindenburg]]’s death, Hitler merges the roles of President and Chancellor, establishing absolute control. Papen is marginalized.
