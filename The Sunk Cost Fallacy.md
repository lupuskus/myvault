- **Description**: The sunk cost fallacy refers to our tendency to continue investing in something (be it time, money, or effort) simply because we’ve already invested in it, even when it no longer makes sense. It’s like throwing good money after bad. Recognizing this fallacy allows us to make more rational decisions by focusing on future costs and benefits rather than past investments.
