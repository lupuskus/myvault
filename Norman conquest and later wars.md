### Norman Conquest as a Root Cause of Later Wars

- **Feudal System and Aristocratic Rivalries**:
  - Introduction of a centralized feudal system created powerful Norman lords with competing loyalties.
  - Complex inheritance disputes fueled internal conflicts, seen later in the Wars of the Roses.

- **Anglo-Norman Claims Over Scotland**:
  - English kings (of Norman descent) sought dominance over Scotland, leading to the Wars of Scottish Independence.
  - Norman nobility held lands in both England and Scotland, complicating loyalties and sparking conflicts.

- **Territorial Ambitions in France**:
  - The Norman Conquest linked English monarchs to French territories (e.g., Normandy, Aquitaine), leading to the Hundred Years’ War.

- **Dynastic Instability**:
  - Norman succession laws led to long-term instability and factionalism, contributing to the Wars of the Roses.

- **Cultural and Legal Integration**:
  - The blending of Norman and Anglo-Saxon cultures created tensions, particularly in the North and Scotland.
  - Norman legal structures centralized power but also laid the groundwork for later conflicts during periods of weak kingship.

This summary highlights how the Norman Conquest laid the foundation for the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Hundred Years’ War, and the Wars of the Roses.
