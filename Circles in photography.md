## Historical Curiosity

- The original Kodak Brownie camera shot in a circular format.
- Circular images mitigated softness at the edges caused by simple lenses.

## Photographic Applications

- **Portraits**: Circular frames emphasize faces.
- **Landscape Photography**: Highlight details within broader scenes.
- **Architectural Photography**: Circular forms (like the Pantheon) can be stunning.
- **Abstract Photography**: Experiment with circular patterns, reflections, and textures.

## Exploring Circular Filters

- **Circular polarizers**: Enhance skies, reduce reflections, and deepen colors.
- **UV filters**: Protect lenses and reduce haze.
- **ND filters**: Control exposure by reducing light entering the lens.
