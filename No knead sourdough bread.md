### Description

My recipe for two loaves of delicious no-knead sourdough bread.

### Ingredients

#### Main dough

- 767g medium-protein bread flour (or all-purpose flour)
- 85g whole wheat flour
- 580g water
- 15g sea salt
- 153g ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration)

#### Topping

- Coarse wheat bran, rolled oats, or sesame seeds for topping (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Autolyse with starter (9:00 a.m.)**To a large mixing bowl, add the flour, 537g water, and sourdough starter and mix with wet hands until no dry bits remain. Cover the bowl and let rest for 30 minutes in autolyse.
2. **Mix** (9:30 a.m.)  
    Add the salt to the top of the dough and pour on the remaining 43g of water to help dissolve. Mix by hand until the salt is incorporated and the dough comes together in a single mass. Transfer to a bulk fermentation container and cover.
3. **Bulk Fermentation** (9:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.)  
    At a warm room temperature, around 74-76°F (23-24°C), bulk should take about 3 1/2 hours. Give the dough four sets of stretches and folds during this time. The first two sets are at 15-minute intervals (10:00 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.) and the last two at 30-minute intervals (10:45 a.m. and 11:15 a.m.). Perform vigorous stretches and folds, as seen below, for the first 3 sets, then a gentle set for the last set. After the last set, let the dough rest for the remainder of bulk fermentation, covered.
4. **Divide and Preshape** (1:15 p.m.)  
    Gently scrape the dough out of the bulk fermentation container and divide it into two pieces. Using wet hands, preshape each piece into a loose round and let rest for 30 minutes, uncovered.
5. **Shape** (1:45 p.m.)  
    Shape each piece of dough into a round (boule), then place the dough in proofing baskets.
6. **Proof** (2:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m., the next day)  
    Cover proofing baskets with reusable plastic and seal shut. Then, place both baskets into the refrigerator and proof overnight.
7. **Bake** (9:00 a.m., the next day)  
    Preheat your oven with a baking surface or combo cooker/Dutch oven inside to 450°F (230°C).
    
    When the oven is preheated, remove your dough from the fridge, score it, and transfer it to the preheated baking surface or combo cooker. Bake for 20 minutes with steam. After this time, vent the steam in the oven or remove the lid (you can keep it in the oven or remove it) and continue to bake for 30 minutes longer. When done, the internal temperature should be around 205°F (96°C).
    
    Let the loaves cool for 2 hours on a wire rack before slicing.
