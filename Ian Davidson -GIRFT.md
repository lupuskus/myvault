	- Talking about risk is useless
	- We are good in getting people out, but not good getting them in
	- Patients should be allowed to upload their history before they are being seen
	- What is it that we cannot deliver in the community that requires admission
	

What are your top 3 priorities to focus on?
1. Alternatives to admission
2. 7 Day Working
3. Identifying pre-admission what needs to be delivered to ensure rapid progress to effective discharge & ongoing community treatment including any likely housing/support packages.
4. Clear outcome focused goals to help person lead best life
5. Developing robust engagement with individuals & communities so they are well engaged and less likely to disengage with services
6. Access to evidence based treatments.
7. Clear Purpose to any step up or step down intensity of service (inc decision to admit/discharge)
8. Ability to be alert to relapse indicators and rapidly able to escalate response before person reaches crisis point.
9. Early supported discharge i.e. create viable discharge/aftercare plan that is well communicated.
10. Timely formulations to allow person to lead their best life
