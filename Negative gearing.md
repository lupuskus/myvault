[[Housing market]]
1.	Start: Investor purchases an investment property.
2.	Rental Income: The property generates rental income.
3.	Deductible Expenses: Expenses such as mortgage interest, property maintenance, and other costs associated with owning the property are deducted.
4.	Net Income: Calculate the net income by subtracting deductible expenses from rental income.
5.	Negative Cash Flow: If the net income is negative (i.e., expenses exceed rental income), it results in a negative cash flow.
6.	Tax Deduction: The investor can use the negative cash flow to offset taxable income from other sources.
7.	[[Tax]] Savings: By reducing taxable income, the investor pays less tax, potentially increasing overall returns on investment.
8.	Future Sale: The investor may anticipate selling the property in the future for a profit, benefiting from capital appreciation.

This flowchart demonstrates how investors use negative gearing to leverage tax benefits while relying on the propertyâ€™s potential for capital growth to offset initial losses.
