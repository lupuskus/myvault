* **[[Network Meta-Analysis]]** are controversial
* **Prospero:** Likely a reference to the Prospero database, a registry for systematic reviews.
* **[[Publication Bias]]:** The tendency for studies with positive results to be more likely to be published.
* **[[Bayesian]] Arm Model:** A statistical model used in network meta-analysis.
* **[[Hedge's g]]:** A standardized effect size measure.
* **[[Cochrane]] Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis:** A tool used to assess the quality of network meta-analyses.
* **Gold Standard Methodology:** A reference to the best available methods for conducting research.
* **[[Incoherence]]/[[Heterogeneity]]:** The presence of [[Inconsistency]] or diverse results across studies.

* **Factors Affecting Effect:** The discussion of what factors might influence the effectiveness of treatments or interventions.
**Potential [[Research]] Questions:**
- Based on the notes, here are some potential research questions:
	1. **How can publication bias be addressed in network meta-analyses?**
	2. **What are the strengths and limitations of Bayesian arm models compared to other statistical models in network meta-analysis?**
	3. **How can the quality of network meta-analyses be improved?**
	4. **What factors contribute to incoherence or heterogeneity in network meta-analyses?**
	5. **What are the specific effects of dancing and yoga, and how do they compare to other interventions?**
**Additional Notes:**
* The mention of "group activities" suggests that the researcher might be interested in the social or psychological aspects of interventions.
* The phrase "standard had bigger effect" is unclear without more context, but it could refer to a particular intervention or methodology.
