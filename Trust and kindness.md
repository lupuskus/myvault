The link below covers the triangle of trust, in a TED talk by Frances Frei.  It explores what can happen when our difference relative to the context we’re in isn’t welcomed, and our inability to be ourselves is seen as inauthentic by others  [https://youtu.be/pVeq-0dIqpk](https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FpVeq-0dIqpk&data=05%7C02%7Cwolfgang.kuster%40nhs.net%7C439166bf3959420c259508dcbd4087ed%7C37c354b285b047f5b22207b48d774ee3%7C0%7C0%7C638593332119533405%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=21Yguf%2B8vepp%2Bk%2BTl661P5DpCbNZz9GTTe4DsOZhK2s%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://youtu.be/pVeq-0dIqpk.
