- Political Controversies: Commodus faced criticism for his perceived self-indulgence and neglect of state affairs. His reign was marked by conspiracies and political intrigues, leading to several attempts on his life.

overview of key developments in Roman history after Commodus:
- Year of the Five Emperors (193 CE): After Commodus’ death, five emperors successively held power in a short span. Septimius Severus emerged victorious, establishing stability and becoming the new emperor.
- Severan Dynasty (193–235 CE): Septimius Severus and his descendants formed the Severan Dynasty. His sons Caracalla and Geta initially ruled jointly, but Caracalla later murdered Geta to secure sole control. The dynasty continued until the assassination of Severus Alexander in 235 CE.
- Crisis of the Third Century: The period following the Severan Dynasty was characterized by political instability, economic decline, and external threats. This era, known as the Crisis of the Third Century, saw frequent changes of rulers, military crises, and invasions by various barbarian groups.
- Diocletian and the Tetrarchy (284–305 CE): To address the challenges of the crisis, Emperor Diocletian established the Tetrarchy, a system where the empire was ruled by four emperors. This structure aimed to improve governance and military defense.
- Constantine the Great (306–337 CE): Constantine, a prominent figure in Roman history, emerged from the Tetrarchy as the sole ruler. He is known for legal and administrative reforms, including the Edict of Milan in 313 CE, which granted religious tolerance to Christians.
- Division of the Roman Empire: Constantine furthered administrative changes, and in 330 CE, he established Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) as the new capital of the Roman Empire. After Constantine’s death, the empire was divided among his sons, leading to the establishment of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.
