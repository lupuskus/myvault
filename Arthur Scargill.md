[[Miners strike]]

- Continued Leadership of NUM: Led the [[National Union of Mineworkers]] until 2002, with the union and coal industry declining further.
- [[Socialists Labour Party]]: Founded the Socialist Labour Party in 1996, aiming to represent traditional socialist values; however, the party struggled to gain significant political traction.
- Legal and Financial Controversies: Faced controversies over funding and expenses, affecting his public image.
- Mixed Legacy: Viewed as a champion of workers’ rights by supporters, but criticized for tactics that some believe contributed to the decline of the British coal industry and the trade union movement.
- Unapologetic Stance:
- [[Neil Kinnock]] maintained that ‘the suicidal vanity of Arthur Scargill’ made the catastrophic defeat of the strike inevitable. [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/25/miners-strike-40-years-anniversary-brassed-off-sherwood)
