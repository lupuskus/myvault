- [[AGE]] - advanced glycation end products
- [[RAGE]] - AGE receptors
- glycation of proteins is an indicator of aging
- [[Glycotoxins]] created by heat reaction between proteins and sugars
- [[Smoking]] increases glycation
- [[Acarbose]] reduces glycation by blocking carbohydrate digestion
- Toxic effects difficult to distinguish from other great produced toxins, [[nitrosamines]] 
- [[Keto diet]] does not reduce glycation, (through ketones?)
- eat low [[Glycemic index]] food
